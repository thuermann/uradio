This is a simple "Internet radio station" playing random songs on a
TCP connection after accepting an HTTP request.  It was useful for
debugging and developing an Internet radio client for mobile use, e.g.
in a car.

This code was mainly hacked in the last one or two hours of a car trip
from Wolfsburg to Ingolstadt in Germany while sitting on the passenger
seat with my laptop on my lap.
